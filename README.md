# Object Detection Using ML

## Overview
This project implements real-time object detection using OpenCV and a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model. It detects objects in both images and video streams. The system can recognize multiple objects using the COCO dataset and display bounding boxes around detected objects.

## Features
- Uses **MobileNet SSD** for object detection
- Detects objects in static images
- Performs real-time detection in video streams
- Supports webcam input as a fallback
- Displays bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores

## Installation
To set up the project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
